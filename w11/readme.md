My plan for the dev 1 project is to build off what I did for the dev 0. I would love to continue off with that project to add the actual functionality to it that I envisioned when we first started.
Create: My plan is that the user will be able to add players from a roster to create a lineup that will give you your total projected points. The user will be able to enter the week and initially choose which players they want to add. User validation will come in the form of correctly choosing a valid lineup with all positions filled.
Read: App will take the selected lineup and generate projections and your weekly total. The app will also compare the players you selected with the ones on your bench and make suggestions for players who might have a higher projection but were left on the bench.
Update: The user will then be able to change a starting player for one that is on the bench and the lineup will resave with a new projection calculated. The app will continue to make suggestions or return a message indicating that an optimal lineup has been chosen. Possibly will have a checkbox to edit say if the player becomes injured at practice that week. You can check the box to remove that player
Delete: The user can choose to keep the suggestion or have the option to delete the suggestion and start over.
